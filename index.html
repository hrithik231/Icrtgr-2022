          <h2>Peer Review Policy</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>The practice of peer review is to ensure that only high quality research is published. It is an objective process at the heart of good scholarly publishing and is carried out by all reputable scientific peer-reviewed conferences. Our reviewers play a vital role in maintaining the high standards in ICRTGR 2022 and all manuscripts are peer reviewed following the procedure outlined below.</li>
            <li>Initial manuscript evaluation: The Conference committee first evaluates all manuscripts. It is rare, but it is possible for an exceptional manuscript to be accepted at this stage. Manuscripts rejected at this stage are insufficiently original, have serious scientific flaws, have poor grammar or English language, or are outside the aims and scope of the ICRTGR 2022. Those that meet the minimum criteria are normally passed on to at least 2 experts for review.</li>
            <li>Type of Peer Review: ICRTGR 2022 employs Single blind reviewing.</li>
            <li>How the reviewer is selected: Whenever possible, reviewers are matched to the paper according to their expertise.</li>
            <li>Reviewer reports: Reviewers are asked to evaluate whether the manuscript: - Is original - Is methodologically sound - Follows appropriate ethical guidelines - Has results which are clearly presented and support the conclusions - Correctly references previous relevant work.</li>
            <li>How long does the review process take? The time required for the review process is dependent on the response of the reviewers. Should the reviewers’ reports contradict one another or a report is unnecessarily delayed, a further expert opinion will be sought. In rare cases for which it is extremely difficult to find a second reviewer to review the manuscript, or when the one reviewer’s report has thoroughly convinced the conference committee, decisions at this stage to accept, reject or ask the author for a revision are made on the basis of only one reviewer’s report. The conference committee’s decision will be sent to the author with recommendations made by the reviewers, which usually includes verbatim comments by the reviewers. Revised manuscripts might be returned to the initial reviewers who may then request another revision of a manuscript.</li>
            <li>Final report: The final decision to accept or reject the manuscript will be sent to the author along with any recommendations made by the reviewers, and may include verbatim comments by the reviewers.</li>
            <li>Final report: The final decision to accept or reject the manuscript will be sent to the author along with any recommendations made by the reviewers, and may include verbatim comments by the reviewers.</li>
            <li>ICRTGR 2022 Conference Committee’s Decision is final: Reviewers’ advise the editor, who is responsible for the final decision to accept or reject the article.</li>
